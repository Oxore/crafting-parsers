# Grammars collection

In this directory one can find a collection of grammars of various languages.
All grammars are written in WSN 
([Wirth Syntax Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth_syntax_notation)),
or rather in a special flavor of it. The flavor is still under development and
some grammars may be incomplete (e.g. don't support non-ascii symbols
explicitly).
