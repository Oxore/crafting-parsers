## Parsers

I like to write parsers and tokenizers.

So far I've built a couple of parsers for simple grammars like
`a=1,dd={e=1,b=2,},c=6` or `[1, [2,]], [3], []`. I would like to understand how
parsers could be implemented without parser generators in various programming
languages without dependencies. And not just parsers, but parser generators may
be too!

Wish me good luck!..
